## Introduction
This is the official repository for the development of the WiGig module network simulator ns-3. The WiGig module introduces a wireless network interface controller based on the WLAN IEEE 802.11ad/ay standards. IEEE 802.11ad/ay standards support wireless networking in the unlicensed 60 GHz band. Our implementation paves the way to perform high fidelity simulations for large dense wireless networks consisting of devices with heterogeneous capabilities and constraints. 

### WiGig Framework Architecture
We provide a **high-fidelity** and **open-source** simulation framework for evaluating the IEEE 802.11ad/ay standards. Our framework consists of four software tools as depicted in the below figure:

![WiGig Framework Architecture](img/WiGigFramework.png)

1. **ns-3 IEEE 802.11ad/ay model:** This is the core of our framework. The model is based on the WiFi module in ns-3. It provides a highly accurate implementation of the IEEE 802.11ad/ay MAC layer with an abstracted PHY layer implementation. Additionally, we provide a realistic millimeter-wave channel model based on channel profiles generated by 60 GHz ray-tracing software.  
1. **Codebook/Beambook Generator:** This is a MATLAB-based application to design codebook instances that define the beam patterns of the phased antenna array(s) within an IEEE 802.11ad/ay enabled device.
1. **NIST Q-D Channel Realization Software:** It is a ray-tracing software developed in MATLAB for accurate indoor and outdoor millimeter-wave channel modeling.
1. **Q-D Interpreter:** It is a Python-based application to visualize the beamforming results obtained through the ns-3 IEEE 802.11ad/ay model together with the simulated scenario generated by the Q-D Realization Software.

### Framework Objectives
1. Provides a high-fidelity research tool for studying, modeling, and analyzing 60 GHz WLAN standards.
1. Allows researchers from academia and industry to design innovative solutions to improve wireless networking in the 60 GHz band. As the IEEE 802.11ad/ay standards leave many points implementation-dependent, users can utilize our framework to propose ideas and evaluate their performance ahead of an actual implementation.
1. Serves as a network planning tool for wireless network operators. The model allows simulating large dense 60 GHz wireless networks before deployment.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
Before using our WiGig module, please do the following:

1. Familiarize yourself with ns-3 and how to install and run simulations in ns-3. Have a look at the official tutorial page of the simulator.
1. Understand WLAN IEEE 802.11 MAC/PHY operations. There are plenty of references on the Internet describing the CSMA/CA protocol and the evolution of the 802.11 protocol.
1. Understand the existing Wifi Model in ns-3 which implements WLAN IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be.
1. Read our publications below to understand our implementation.
1. Consult our [Wiki page](https://github.com/wigig-tools/wigig-module/wiki) for more detailed information regarding our implementation.

Once you have completed all these steps, you can proceed with cloning and building the project.

### Building the Project
Clone the project to your local system using the following command:

     git clone https://github.com/wigig-tools/wigig-module.git

To build the project in debug mode, type the following commands:

    ./waf configure --disable-examples --disable-tests --disable-python --enable-modules='core','applications','wifi','spectrum','flow-monitor','point-to-point','buildings'
    ./waf build

To build the project in optimized mode for fast execution type the following commands:

    ./waf configure --disable-examples --disable-tests --disable-python --enable-modules='applications','core','internet','point-to-point','wifi','flow-monitor','spectrum' --enable-static -d optimized
    ./waf build

Warning: The previous command will generate large executable files. Make sure you have enough free space in your system.

### How to Run
Our WiGig module includes an extensive set of tutorial scripts located in the scratch folder. A user can explore these examples to test and validate the performance of our framework. At the beginning of each simulation script, we added a detailed description regarding the tested functionality, network topology, expected output, and usage method.
